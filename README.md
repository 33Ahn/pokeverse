# Pokeverse

Over the next few weeks we‚Äôll be building a digital Pokemon (simplified) card game. Complete with features like:
- Viewing and searching Pokemon ‚Äúcards‚Äù
- Viewing and comparing stats
- Adding Pokemon cards to a deck
- Opportunities for you to expand functionality like dueling 2 Pokemon against each other. 

## Setup

- Fork this repo, clone to your desktop, and install dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
- Start the server, and navigate to `localhost:1234`
  ```sh
  npm run start
  ```
- Lint `.js` and `.jsx` files
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```

## Part 1: Fetch and Search
**GOAL**: Using the React Bootstrap CSS Framework and the pokeapi:
- Fetch and render a list of 150 Pokemon cards - each with limited information (picture, name, abilities).
- Add a search feature to find a specific Pokemon.

![Pokeverse Week 1 finished project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44912347/203077513-485464b8-607f-429a-8e12-033b566f2abd.gif)

Use the following instructions to guide your coding:
1. Get the Pokemon!
    - Fetch using the provided `pokeApi` url and set the returned data on state. 
    - **NOTE**: The API returns a `data.results` array of objects, each one containing just an ID, a Name, and a URL. That returned URL will be used to fetch the rest of the data about the Pokemon. [Here is an example](https://gist.github.com/CalamityAdam/06b998539c45f4fb8c5c5afab7a97154#httpspokeapicoapiv2pokemonlimit5) `response` from the API.
2. Iterate over the `pokemonList` array and for each pokemon render a single PokemonCard passing the name and url to the card.
3. Inside `PokemonCard` fetch the provided URL and set the returned data from this URL on state
    - Note the return of this URL is vastly different from the return of the above `pokeApi` URL. This URL will return all the data about a specific Pokemon.
    - For now, we‚Äôll specifically want to pay attention to `sprites` and `abilities`.
    - [Here is an example](https://gist.github.com/CalamityAdam/06b998539c45f4fb8c5c5afab7a97154#httpspokeapicoapiv2pokemon1-abbreviated) of the response from this URL    
4. Import a `Card` component from [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/cards/), and render it, including the following pieces:
    - `Card.Img` - use `pokemon.sprites.front_default` as the img‚Äôs src
    - `Card.Title` with the `name` of the pokemon
    - `Card.Text` with a `ul` of all of that pokemon‚Äôs abilities
    - At this point, we should see a list of all the pokemon cards in the UI, though it may be ugly and/or unstyled
5. In `App.js` add an `InputGroup` with a `FormControl` to allow user to enter pokemon name (see [react-bootstrap InputGroup docs](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/forms/input-group/))
6. Connect an `onChange` that will filter the list of pokemon
    - There‚Äôs a few ways to handle this, refer to previous exercises for inspiration or come up with another way on your own!
    - At this point the list should be searchable
7. Style the page a little bit more, try to center things and render the whole page in a `Container` and many `Row`/`Col`
8. Save and push your changes back to your GitHub repository!

## Part 2: Pokemon Details Page
**GOAL**: By the end of this section, clicking on a single Pokemon should navigate to that pokemon‚Äôs Details page and display all of their stats!

![Part 2 Exemplar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44912347/203079828-4daf67a2-d45b-4e7f-8fe3-9329aff9d2c4.gif)

1. Continue from your Pokeverse repo that you used in the last section and checkout a new branch:
    - To checkout a new branch, run the following command:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b adds-react-router
    ```
    - This will create a new branch named `‚Äùadds-react-router‚Äù` and then switch your local branch version to the new branch. When you‚Äôre done with this lesson feel free to merge your new branch into `main` or better yet - submit a Pull Request to your repo and review your code yourself and then merge it in! üöÄ
2. Install React Router:
```sh
npm i react-router-dom@6
```
3. Create a new directory `src/routes/` and in it create a file called `Home.js`
```sh
mkdir src/routes/
touch src/routes/Home.js 
```
4. Move almost everything out of App.js into routes/Home.js EXCEPT:
    - The initial `useEffect` that fetches all of the pokemon
    - The `pokemonList` state
    - The container `div` and `<Navigation />`
5. `Home` should expect the `pokemonList` array as a prop - and will handle the searching and filtering of the `filteredPokemon` array.
6. Create a new file `src/routes/PokemonDetails.js`. This component will display all of the pokemon's stats! We'll come back to this component later.
7. In `App` set up a `BrowserRouter` that wraps everything that's left in the component.
8. Inside of the `<BrowserRouter>`, below `<Navigation />`, add a `<Routes>` component.
9. Inside of `Routes`, add 2 routes:
    - One with a path of `"/"` that renders the newly crated `Home` component and passes `pokemonList` to it
    - The other with a path of `"/:name"` that renders the newly created PokemonDetails component. Notice the `:` before name, this is a special syntax for URL params, we'll be able to access the value of name later!
10. Inside of the `PokemonDetails` component:
    - Add a new state of pokemon with initial value of `null`
    - Import and call `useParams`. This is how we'll access that `name` param we added earlier!
    ```javascript
    const params = useParams();
    ```
    - Inside of a `useEffect`, `fetch` all of the details about this pokemon using the name from the params and then `setPokemon` with the fetched data.
    ```plaintext
    https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${params.name}
    ```
    - Since we'll be waiting for data to be fetched, we can conditionally render the page! To do this we can add 2 separate `return statements`. The first will be wrapped in an if statement
    ```javascript
      if (!pokemon) {
        return <>loading...</>;
      }

    return (
      // ... the rest of the component here
    )
    ```
11. Now let's add all of the stats about the pokemon like such: 
```plaintext
height: {pokemon.height}
weight: {pokemon.weight}
abilities: iterate over pokemon.abilities, and for each ability render the ability.ability.name
types: iterate over pokemon.types and for each type render the type.type.name
stats: iterate over pokemon.stats and for each stat render the stat.stat.name and stat.base_stat
```
12. Finally, let's link to the newly created route and component! In `PokemonCard.js`, wrap the `{name}` of the Pokemon with a `<Link>` with a to value of `/${name}`
```jsx
<Link to={`/${name}`}>
  {name}
</Link>
```
13. **BONUS #1**: Right now `PokemonDetails` is probably just plain text, and pretty boring looking. Since we already have React Bootstrap installed, check out the `Components` section of [the React Bootstrap docs](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/) and see how you can style the page! 
14. **BONUS #2**: Right now the All Pokemon link works like a normal anchor tag (when clicked the page loads/refreshes), but we want to use React Router, with no page refresh! Convert the `Nav.Link` to use the properties of the `Link` component by passing it the `as={Link}` prop, and switch out the `href` for a to prop. The [react-bootstrap docs](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/navs/) have examples of other components like `Nav.Item` using the `as` prop.
